 * The Strategy Design Pattern can be used, for example, to determine how a unit moves in the StarCraft game.

The pattern consists in having a different strategy to one functionality. A unit, for example, could move by walking or flying.
Your Task

Complete the code so that when a Viking is flying its position increases by 10 each time it moves. If it is walking then the position is increased by 1.
In this Kata, Viking starts as a ground unit when it is created.

You have 3 classes:
Viking: has a position, moveBehavior and move method.
Fly and Walk: the move behaviors with the move(unit) method. Fly has to move 10 positions at a time and Walk has to move 1.
